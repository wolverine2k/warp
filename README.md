## About

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev) is an agentic development environment, born out of the terminal. Use Warp's built-in coding agent, or bring your own CLI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and others).

## Bring Your Own Provider (BYOP)

&nbsp;

Warp's Agent Mode supports **custom AI providers** alongside the built-in Warp cloud models. Configure multiple providers simultaneously and pick a specific provider and model per conversation — all from **Settings > AI > Custom AI Providers**.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | API Type | Streaming | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | OpenAI-compatible | SSE | GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, o-series, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| **Anthropic** | Native Messages API | SSE | Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku via `api.anthropic.com` or self-hosted relays |
| **Ollama** | Native `/api/chat` | NDJSON | Local models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, etc.) with native tool-call support |
| **Google Gemini** | Native `generateContent` | SSE | Gemini 1.5/2.0 via `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` |
| **DeepSeek** | OpenAI-compatible | SSE | DeepSeek-Chat and DeepSeek-Reasoner (chain-of-thought rendered separately) |

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LM Studio, vLLM, text-generation-inference, LocalAI, etc.) works out of the box with the **OpenAI** API type.

### Key Features

- **Multiple providers at once** — run Ollama locally, Anthropic in the cloud, and a remote OpenAI-compatible box side by side. Each conversation picks its own provider and model.
- **One-click model discovery** — the **Fetch models** button queries each provider's upstream model-list endpoint; the **Browse catalog** modal pre-fills metadata from the open-source [models.dev](https://models.dev) catalog.
- **Multimodal attachments** — attach images, PDFs, and audio files to agent turns via the file-picker button, drag-and-drop, or paste-from-clipboard. Each adapter translates attachments into the provider's native wire format. Per-model capability chips (image / pdf / audio) in settings control which modalities are allowed.
- **Dedicated compaction model** — route conversation summarization to a separate, cheaper model (e.g., Haiku or a local Ollama model) while the primary agent model handles reasoning and tool use. Configure via the **Summarization model** dropdown in the BYOP settings section.
- **Test connection** — per-provider probe button confirms endpoint reachability before you start a conversation.
- **Auto-migration** — existing single-provider configurations are migrated automatically on first launch.

### Configuration

Providers are stored in `settings.toml` under `agents.warp_agent.providers`. API keys are stored in the OS keychain. See [`specs/multi-local-llm/design.md`](https://github.com/wolverine2k/warp/blob/multi-local-llm/specs/multi-local-llm/design.md) for the full architecture and [`specs/multi-local-llm/README.md`](https://github.com/wolverine2k/warp/blob/multi-local-llm/specs/multi-local-llm/README.md) for per-phase implementation status.

## Installation

You can [download Warp](https://www.warp.dev/download) and [read our docs](https://docs.warp.dev/) for platform-specific instructions.

## Oz for OSS

Maintaining a popular open-source project? [Apply for Oz credits](https://tally.so/r/LZWxqG) to explore [Oz for OSS](https://github.com/warpdotdev/oz-for-oss).

Oz for OSS is our partner program for bringing the same agentic open-source management workflows used in this repository to select partner repositories. We work directly with maintainers to implement workflows for issue triage, PR review, community management, and contributor coordination in a way that fits each project.

## Licensing

Warp's UI framework (the `warpui_core` and `warpui` crates) are licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE-MIT).

The rest of the code in this repository is licensed under the [AGPL v3](LICENSE-AGPL).

## Open Source & Contributing

Warp's client codebase is open source and lives in this repository. We welcome community contributions and have designed a lightweight workflow to help new contributors get started. For the full contribution flow, read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

> [!TIP]
> **Chat with contributors and the Warp team** in the [`#oss-contributors`](https://warpcommunity.slack.com/archives/C0B0LM8N4DB) Slack channel — a good place for ad-hoc questions, design discussion, and pairing with maintainers. New here? [Join the Warp Slack community](https://go.warp.dev/join-preview) first, then jump into `#oss-contributors`.

### Issue to PR

Before filing, [search existing issues](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) for your bug or feature request. If nothing exists, [file an issue](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/new/choose) using our templates. Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-security-issues).

Once filed, a Warp maintainer reviews the issue and may apply a readiness label: [`ready-to-spec`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aready-to-spec) signals the design is open for contributors to spec out, and [`ready-to-implement`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aready-to-implement) signals the design is settled and code PRs are welcome. Anyone can pick up a labeled issue — mention **@oss-maintainers** on an issue if you'd like it considered for a readiness label.

### Building the Repo Locally

To build and run Warp from source:

```bash
./script/bootstrap   # platform-specific setup
./script/run         # build and run Warp
./script/presubmit   # fmt, clippy, and tests
```

See [WARP.md](WARP.md) for the full engineering guide, including coding style, testing, and platform-specific notes.
