//! Local-channel `warp-tui` binary (internal dev builds).
//!
//! Mirrors `app/src/bin/local.rs`: loads the internal `local` channel config
//! (via the `warp-channel-config` generator) and layers the dev feature flags,
//! then hands off to the shared TUI entry point. Run it through
//! `./script/run-tui`, which installs the generator first; running it directly
//! without `warp-channel-config` on PATH will panic with install instructions.
